Data Preparation
1. In this project, you will use the Fashion-MNIST dataset using a CNN neural 
network architecture. 
You can use keras/tensorflow or write your own routines.
1) First, download the data file, load it, and 
1. Describe the data
2. Clean the data 
3. Check the data for missing values or duplicates and carry out proper correction 
methods
4. Visualize the data using proper visualization methods. 
5. Draw some of the images 
6. Carry out required correlation analysis
2) Carry out any required preprocessing operations on the data 
3) Encode the labels
Training a CNN neural network 
In this exercise you need to implement a LeNet-5 network to recognize the FashionMNIST digits. 
• Modify hyperparameters to get to the best performance you can achieve. 
• Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
• In the report, provide a plot of accuracy improvement using the previously 
mentioned techniques. Also plot the convergence curve for LeNet-5. 
• Comment on why you think LeNet-5 further improves the accuracy if any at all. 
And if it doesn't, why not? 
• Note that this is an open-ended problem. So, there could be very good solutions.
• Try to use other two CNN models (using transfer learning) and compare the 
results with the full trained LeNet-5.
